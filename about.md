<img src="http://bateyt.github.io/Anth205/figs/ProfileImageHolder.jpg">

Hello, my name is Trey Batey. I am a biological anthropologist---specializations in bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology---and faculty member in the Social Science Program at Lower Columbia College in Longview, Washington. I also hold adjunct positions at Eastern Oregon University and Mt. Hood Community College.


#### About the course...
ANTH 205 is a survey course that introduces students to biological anthropology, a field of study that addresses questions concerned with human variation, primarily within the context of biological (and biocultural) evolution.
